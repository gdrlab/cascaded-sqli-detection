# Hybrid Features Extraction Approach using Natural Language Processing for Improved Detection of SQL Injection Attack

This is the implementation of "Hybrid Features Extraction Approach using Natural Language Processing for Improved Detection of SQL Injection Attack" algorithm. It can load the custom datasets, train various models and demonstrate their inference performances. 

## Setup and Installation
It can run on virtual Python environment on Win, Mac or Linux.

- Download and install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) environment.
- Open Anaconda Prompt and change current directory to the project folder. 
- Run the following command in the folder, where rafi-sqli.yml file resides. This will create a new Python environment with the required packages:
    -  ``` conda env create -f rafi-sqli.yml ```
- Activate the environment
    - ``` conda activate rafi-sql ```
- Build and install the nlp_hybrid package by running:
    - ``` python setup.py install ```
- Then run the package:
    - ``` nlp_hybrid ```
    - ``` all ```
